# Software Template â€” CrewAI Agent

This Software Template can be used to create a new source code repository and a new GitOps deployment repository for a **CrewAI Agent Application**.

The generated application provisions a containerized **CrewAI agent** that connects to an existing LLM backend (for example, [Llama-Stack](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-stack) or any other OpenAI-compatible service).  
It uses the [CrewAI framework](https://docs.crewai.com) to define the agent role, goal, backstory, and tasks.  
Configuration is controlled entirely through environment variables, making the application portable and easy to deploy on Kubernetes or OpenShift.
