## Application Information

The application created by this Agentic AI Framework Template uses an existing model service and supports multiple agents with configurable tools.

This application relies on [Crew AI Agentic Framework](https://docs.crewai.com/) to orchestrate multiple agents working together on tasks, uses [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) for the UI layer, and supports [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) for tool integration.

## Features

- **Multiple Agents**: Configure multiple agents with different roles, goals, and backstories
- **Default & Custom LLMs**: Set a default LLM for all agents, with optional per-agent LLM overrides
- **MCP Tools Integration**: Connect agents to MCP tool servers for enhanced capabilities
- **Task Orchestration**: Define tasks and assign them to specific agents
- **Streamlit UI**: Interactive web interface to run crews and view results
